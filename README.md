Rely is a tool for vetting GitHub dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Rely is in active development and certain features may be incomplete.


We need to know if we can **rely** on packages before we add them as dependencies in our own projects.  Rely scores GitHub repositories based on a number of metrics, including time since last commit, star count, open issues, documentation, and more.  Rely is partially inspired by a discussion of the metrics that are used to evaluate open source projects on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17257062).

## Installation

1. Create a GitHub personal access token ([guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens))

2. Set the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable (token from step 1):
   ```sh
   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
   ```

3. Install and run `rely` with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):
   ```sh
   uv add rely
   uv run rely https://github.com/1cph93/rely
   ```

   Or just run it as a tool:
   ```sh
   uv tool run rely https://github.com/1cph93/rely
